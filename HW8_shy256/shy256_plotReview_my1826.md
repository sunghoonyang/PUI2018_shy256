Plot Review by Muci Yu my1826

CLARITY: The plot is a little to sophisticated to read. Tex text on the horizontal axis is crowed and not intuitive to read. 

ESTHETIC: The graph looks good. I like the color scheme a lot. However, it is not a very good way to convey the information. The x-axis has already been over-crowded, having three bars for each x makes it even hard to deliver the information in a effective manner.

HONESTY: The data is very honest, especially for standardizing the data, which can reduce the bias caused by the sizes of different locations.

To improve your plot, I would suggest to reconsider what to put on the horizontal axis. Usually, there is a logical transition from left to right of the axis, so it might be better to put something that has logical meaning from left to right instead of locations.
