I think the title of the plot is a little confusing. There is so much packed into the horizontal axis that I could barely 
read the xlable of the plot. I think reading the plot would be much easier if in the annotation we have additional information 
about the 'Standarding'. I also think, while the xlabel parameters could be rotated for easier viewing, I am against rotating
them all the way to 90 degrees; I also think we could benefit by reducing the number of the xlabel parameters by 
clustering them into a region of the city. UWS, UES, etc.
